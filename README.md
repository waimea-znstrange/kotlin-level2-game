## Project Description


The game rules...


## Chain Reaction 💣

### Game Setup
- A row of 12 squares, numbered 1 to 12 from left to right
- The board starts empty
- Both players have a supply of 'bombs' (counters) in their own colour
- Decide who goes first

### Gameplay
- Players take turns - You may not skip your turn
- On your turn you must place one of your bombs on an empty square, but ...
- You cannot place your bomb directly between two opponent bombs since it would immediately be 'defused' (see the defuse rule below)
- After placing, the following rules apply (in order):
    - Defuse rule:  if any opponent bomb now has one of your bombs on each side, it is 'defused' and removed from the board (note: two bombs can be defused in one go)
    - Chain reaction rule: if your bomb creates an unbroken chain of 3 or more of your own bombs, the entire chain 'explodes' - all bombs in the chain are removed and you score points equal to the length of the chain

### Win Condition
- The first player to reach 10 points wins
